🧮 FlexiCalc
A graphical calculator built in Python with Tkinter, structured with tabs and multiple functionalities for students, professionals, and general use. This project was designed with a focus on modularity, clarity, and flexibility.

📌 Features
The system is divided into three main tabs:
1. Arithmetic Calculations
- Basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Exponentiation (x²) and square root (√).
- Percentage calculations with support for expressions like 100 + 25% or 250 - 10%.
- Real-time evaluation as numbers are entered.
- Expression clearing with "CE".
2. Temperature Conversion
- Convert between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin:
- Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit
- Celsius ↔ Kelvin
- Fahrenheit ↔ Kelvin
- Intuitive interface with unit selection and numerical input field.
3. Geometric Area Calculation
- Automatic area calculations for:
- Circle
- Rectangle
- Triangle
- Trapezoid
- Square
- Dynamically generated fields based on the selected shape.

💡 Highlights
- ✅ Modern graphical interface with dark mode enabled by default.
- ✅ Responsive layout with well-organized and centered buttons.
- ✅ Unified display for calculation results across all tabs.
- ✅ Modularized code, with separate files for easy maintenance and future expansion.
- ✅ Ideal project for educational purposes, portfolio presentations, and daily use.

🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.11+
- Tkinter (Native Python GUI framework)
- ttk (Themed Tkinter widgets)
- Modular programming, with clear separation of responsibilities (GUI, arithmetic logic, conversions, and geometry).
